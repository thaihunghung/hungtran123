With AI Engine, create a ChatGPT-like chatbot (or many of them, with different features and behaviors), generate content, images, let you organize everything in templates, quickly suggest titles and excerpts, track your OpenAI usage stats, and much more! Then explore the AI Playground to try out a variety of AI tools like translation, correction, SEO, suggestion, WooCommerce product fields, etc. There is also an internal API so other plugins can tap into its capabilities. We'll be adding even more AI tools and features to the AI Engine based on your feedback!

== Chatbot (ChatGPT-like) ==

Looking to add some AI-powered chat functionality to your website? Our chatbot is here to help! Using vanilla JS on the frontend, it's lightweight and easy to use, with this shortcode: [mwai_chatbot]. Looks simple? Yes, but there are many parameters and countless ideas. Visit the [official documentation](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/) for more info. 

== Optimize/Generate Content ==

Generate articles with customizable headings, language, and other parameters. Feel free to play around with the settings and even modify the prompts to craft exactly the content you need. You can also generate images using DALL-E model. Keep in mind that currently, the images generated are only in square format (1024x1024) and there are some limitations (OpenAI is in beta).

== Train/Finetune your AI Model ==

In the Fine Tuning section of AI Engine, you can prepare/generate datasets, and train new models based on them, in just a few click! Please check my article on [How to Train an AI Model](https://meowapps.com/wordpress-chatbot-finetuned-model-ai/).

== My Dream for AI ==

I am thrilled about the endless opportunities that AI brings. But, at the same time, I can't help but hope for a world where AI is used for good, and not just to dominate the web with generated content. My dream is to see AI being utilized to enhance our productivity, empower new voices to be heard (because let's be real, not everyone is a native speaker or may have challenges when it comes to writing), and help us save time on tedious tasks so we can spend more precious moments with our loved ones and the world around us.

I will always advocate this, and I hope you do too 💕

== Open AI ==

The AI Engine utilizes the API from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com). This plugin does not gather any information from your OpenAI account except for the number of tokens utilized. The data transmitted to the OpenAI servers primarily consists of the content of your article and the context you specify. The usage shown in the plugin's settings is just for reference. It is important to check your usage on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage) for accurate information. Please also review their [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Service](https://openai.com/terms/) for further information.

== Usage ==

1. Create an account at OpenAI.
2. Create an API key and insert in the plugin settings (Meow Apps -> AI Engine).
3. Enjoy the features of AI Engine!
5. ... and always keep an eye on [your OpenAI usage](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage)!

Languages: English.
